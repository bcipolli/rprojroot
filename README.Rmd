This package helps accessing files relative to a *project root* to [stop the working directory insanity](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/362f52446fe1ebc4c49f).
It is a low-level helper package for the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) package.

```{r}
library(rprojroot)
```


## Example

The rprojroot package works best when you have a "project": all related files contained in a subdirectory that can be categorized using a strict criterion.
Let's create a package for demonstration.

```{r}
dir <- tempfile()
pkg <- usethis::create_package(dir)
```

R packages satisfy the `is_r_package` criterion.
A criterion is an object that contains a `find_file()` function.
With `pkg` as working directory, the function works like `file.path()`, rooted at the working directory:

```{r}
setwd(pkg)
is_r_package
is_r_package$find_file()
is_r_package$find_file("tests", "testthat")
```

This works identically when starting from a subdirectory:

```{r}
setwd(file.path(pkg, "R"))
is_r_package$find_file()
is_r_package$find_file("tests", "testthat")
```

As long as you are sure that your working directory is somewhere inside your project, you can retrieve the project root.


## Installation and further reading

Install the package from CRAN:

``` r
install.package("rprojroot")
```

See the [documentation](https://r-lib.github.io/rprojroot/articles/rprojroot.html) for more detail.
