Resumbission upon CRAN's request, to fix brittle tests (again).

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci, R devel, release, and oldrel)
* OS X (on travis-ci, R release)
* win-builder (devel and release)


## R CMD check results

* "Subdirectories" is spelled correctly.


## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 21 downstream dependencies, same check results for current CRAN version and release candidate.
